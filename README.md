If Aux is ever published, and this file is ever read by a user who decided to play, thanks for the support, and feel free to send these files to your friends, I want this game to get as big as possible, and I want to push this passion project to 11. If this game ever costs actual money, please pirate it, without piracy I wouldnt have been able to make this game, without that inspiration and easy access to culture, this wouldn't exsist. Have fun, pirate games, and love all.
